proj0-checker
=============

Script which validates basic functionality for Project 0 

Place `check_proj0.js` into the same directory as `projzero.js`, and you can run it at any command line that has node installed:

`$ node check_proj0.js`

If you don't already have Node.js installed, there is an install guide located at https://github.com/6170-fa14/6.170-guides/blob/master/Install.md.

Keep in mind that this is just a simple check to make sure we can run your functions and is *not* the test suite we'll use to grade your code. Make sure your code meets the requirements as described on the project 0 assignment page before submitting.
